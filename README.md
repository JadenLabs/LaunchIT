# LaunchIT
---

## What is this?

LaunchIT is a super simple script made to launch multiple processes quickly.

This is made for me to launch all my projects and code all at once - without the need for docker.

## Can I add stuff?

This isn't a 'project' of mine, just a simple thing I wrote on a plane.

However, if you would like to expand upon this, feel free to make a PR or fork the repo.
